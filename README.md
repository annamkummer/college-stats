## Abstract
  - This application uses data.gov's College Scorecard API to allow prospective students to find Universities by state and enrollment size. 
  - After entering the search parameters, students can view a few stats about the school and link to the University's homepage.
  - Students can bookmark schools they're interested in. Saved schools persist on reload via localStorage.
